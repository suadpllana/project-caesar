# Which cells could still end up welded to this one.
#
# The question is never "what is joined now" but "what could a still-open tag
# join later", so the answer is worked out over the tags that have not shut. A
# tag speaks about every key in its pool, so any two cells it touches are one
# declaration apart, and a chain of such declarations reaches further still.
#
# The chain is not free. Welding a chain welds everything on it into one cell,
# and a bar standing between any two of those cells says that cell can never
# exist. So a route counts only when the whole group it would create is clear of
# bars - not merely its ends, and not merely its consecutive steps. That is why
# this is a search over growing groups rather than a walk over edges: the group
# is what a bar forbids.
