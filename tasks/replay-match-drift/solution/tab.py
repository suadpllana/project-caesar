"""The recorded history, indexed once on the axes the rules count on.

Three different counters read three different things and the task turns on their being
different: a command is matched to the recorded command at its position among those OF ITS
KIND, its answer is the recorded answer at its position among those of that KIND AND NAME
together, and a signal is taken at its position among those of its TAG. Every one of them
also needs the position of the line in the history, because that position is what decides
which branch runs next.

Everything is built in one pass, because the history is fixed before the body starts.
